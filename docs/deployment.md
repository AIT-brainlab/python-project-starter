# CI/CD, Deployment & Traefik Overlay

This document describes the deployment architecture, Traefik reverse proxy overlay, and remote host automation used across **dev**, **stg**, and **production** environments.

## 1. Branching & Promotion Lifecycle

```
[feature/xxx] ---> [dev] (tag vX.Y.Z -> CI builds & pushes to GHCR)
                    │
                    ▼ (PR merge)
                  [stg] (CD deploys to Staging)
                    │
                    ▼ (PR merge)
                  [main] (CD deploys to Production)
```

1. **Development (`dev`)**:
   - Default working branch. Pushes directly to `dev` do not deploy.
   - Run tests locally with `bash scripts/check.sh`.
2. **Release to GHCR (`v*`)**:
   - Cut release: `bash scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z`.
   - Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, running tests and pushing images (`vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y`, `latest`) to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).
3. **Staging Promotion (`stg`)**:
   - Open PR: `bash scripts/release.sh pr stg` (or `gh pr create --base stg --head dev`).
   - Merging into `stg` automatically deploys to the Staging server.
4. **Production Promotion (`main`)**:
   - Open PR: `bash scripts/release.sh pr main` (or `gh pr create --base main --head stg`).
   - Merging into `main` automatically deploys to the Production server.

## 2. GitHub Environments & Credentials

Configure two environments in GitHub (**Settings > Environments**): `staging` and `production`. Both execute the exact same deployment job in `.github/workflows/cd.yml`.

| Variable / Secret | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NETBIRD_KEY` or `NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY` | Secret | NetBird mesh VPN setup key for runner access |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Secret | SSH private key to authenticate against deployment server |
| `SERVER_HOST` | Variable | Target server IP or NetBird mesh hostname |
| `SERVER_USER` | Variable | Target server SSH user |
| `SERVER_PROJECT_DIR` | Variable | Target directory on host (e.g. `/opt/python-project-starter`) |
| `NETBIRD_MANAGEMENT_URL` | Variable | *(Optional)* Self-hosted NetBird management URL |

## 3. Traefik Reverse Proxy Overlay

In staging and production, applications run behind a shared Traefik gateway that manages Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates and listens on ports `80`/`443`.

### Local Development
In local `.env`:
```ini
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
FASTAPI_PORT=8000
```
Application maps directly to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Remote Servers (dev / stg / prod)
In the server's `.env`:
```ini
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.traefik.yml
APP_HOSTNAME_DOMAIN=api-stg.ait.ac.th
```
Docker Compose automatically layers [`docker-compose.traefik.yml`](../docker-compose.traefik.yml), connects the container to the external `traefik_public` network, and registers routing and SSL with Traefik.

## 4. Fail-Forward Policy & Rollback

- **Smoke Testing**: Every deployment executes `scripts/smoke-test.sh` verifying `/health`, index route, and Django checks before declaring success.
- **Persistent Baseline (`.deploy_success`)**: The deployed commit SHA is saved in `.deploy_success` only after tests pass.
- **Zero-Touch Rollback**: If deployment or smoke tests fail, the workflow immediately checks out the previous verified SHA from `.deploy_success` and redeploys it, restoring the host to a stable baseline.
